**Description:** Dive into the world of web app hacking and privilege escalation with this TryHackMe machine, exploiting recent vulnerabilities.
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Machine Link:** [CMSpit on TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/cmspit)

## 1. Enumeration

Two ports are open:
- 22 [SSH on Ubuntu]
- 80 [HTTP]

Heading to port 80, we discover the landing page below. After a basic icon check, we confirm this is Cockpit CMS.

## 2. Exploitation

Searching for "cockpit" in msfconsole, I identified a promising exploit.

Configuring rhost, lhost, and lport, I executed the exploit successfully. Here's the output.

Next, I selected the 'admin' user and reran the exploit, gaining a shell.

## 3. Privilege Escalation

Now operating as www-data, I navigated to the home directory and discovered a user named `stux`.

Accessing user stuxâ€™s homepage, I stumbled upon an intriguing dbshell file. Examining its contents revealed the second flag and what appears to be a password.

Eager to progress, I tested the discovered password and successfully gained access. Running `sudo -l` provided an interesting output:

The discovered permissions open up new avenues for privilege escalation. Let's leverage this and continue the exploration!

## 4. Ultimate Privilege Escalation

With the acquired sudo permissions for user `stux`, further investigation led me to an intriguing exploit for ExifTool (CVE-2021-22204). The exploit requires some prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt install djvulibre-bin exiftool
```

The usage involves setting up a listener:

```bash
nc -nvlp 9090  # or the port you specify in the exploit.py file
python3 exploit.py
```

Then, upload the generated image to the target machine and run:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/exiftool image.jpg
```

Executing this payload triggered a successful root shell!
